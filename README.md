## Hotel Management System Overview
This project acts as a basic hotel management system by handling user authentication securely.

### How it Manages a Hotel?

1) User Registration & Authentication 🏨🔐
Each staff member or guest must register with a secure username and password.
The system prevents weak passwords to ensure data security.

2) Staff Access & Role Management 🏢👨‍💼
The system can be used to differentiate between hotel staff and guests.
Only authorized personnel can manage bookings, check-ins, and other operations.

3) Customer Check-in & Check-out 🛎️🔑
Guests can log in to the system before making reservations.
Upon check-out, the guest profile can be deleted if necessary.

4) Room Booking & Management 🏠📅
While this version doesn’t directly handle room bookings, it can be extended to allow users to book, modify, or cancel reservations.

5) Password & Account Management 🔄🔑
Users (staff or guests) can change their login credentials for security reasons.
If an employee leaves, their account can be deleted to prevent unauthorized access.

6) Security & Data Protection 🔐✅
Strong authentication ensures hotel data remains secure.
Prevents unauthorized users from accessing hotel management features.
